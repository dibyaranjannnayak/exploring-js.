// As for each doesn't return anything though we have some methods to do it, we use filter() and map()
/*
The filter() method in JavaScript is an array method used to create a new array, 
containing only the elements from the original array that satisfy a specific condition. It does not modify the original array.
*/

/*
array.filter(callbackFunction(element, index, array))
*/

/*
✔ Loops through each element
✔ Checks a condition (callback function)
✔ Returns a new array with elements that passed the condition
✖ Doesn’t change the original array
