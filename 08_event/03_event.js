/*
timeStamp in event::

- Every event in JavaScript (like click, scroll, keydown, etc.) automatically includes a built-in timeStamp property.
- console.log(event.timeStamp);

event.timeStamp returns the time (in milliseconds) when the event was created.

This value represents the number of milliseconds elapsed since the time the page (or document) was loaded — 
 not the actual date/time of the system clock.

- In simple words, it gives the time of occurance of the event from the last time the page got loaded.
